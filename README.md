MSLPrettyUserBar
================

Using the files here you should be able to re-create the ‘pretty user bar’ from the Kent Union website.

Simply copy the html from index.html into a template or template snippet (It’s been taken directly from the Kent Union site) and include the JS files and CSS files supplied. Once you’ve done that use JQuery or similar to hide and reveal the div.

It (should) be as simple as that. If you have any issues just email m.rayner@kent.ac.uk.
